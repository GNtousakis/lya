# All the working synthetic examples are here

        - A very very basic test case checks policy 1,2,6

## t2 
        - Test case that checks that everything prints on the right module

## t3
        - Test case that checks for the global variables (globa.x, global.y, x, y)

## t4
        - Checks that everything prints and check if we need to add     more things to the json files
