# Description of Test Cases

## chalk 
	- t1 => simple test case to demonstate that the import works with lya
	- t2 => more test cases 
	- error => things to fix in chalk

## commander 
	- t1 => simple test case to demonstate that the import works with lya	

## fs-extra
	- t1 => simple test case to demonstate that the import works with lya

## lodash - Works
	- t1 => simple test case to demonstate that the import works with lya
	- t2 => expanded test to cover most usecases of lodash

## moment 
	- t1 => simple test case to demonstate that the import works with lya
	- t2 => more elegant test case from moment repo 

## t1 
	- A very very basic test case 

## t2 
	- Test case that checks that everything prints on the right module

## t3
	- Test case that checks for the global variables (globa.x, global.y, x, y)

## t4
	- Checks that everything prints and check if we need to add	more things to the json files

## t5
	- Test case for the time analysis. For analysis 3-4. It runs 2 big loops
	in diff module and returns time

## t6
	- Runs mod1 which will loop and randomly call either mod3 (50%) or mod4 (50%)
	and runs mod2 which will loop and randomly call either mod3 (75%) or mod4 (25%).
	This is for time analysis.
